# Problem-solving
In this repositery, I stack a growing number of solutions to algorithmic problems I found to be most interesting so far, using C++ optimization skills.

The problem statements come from a variety of online competitions that use different judges and databases such as CodeForces, DMOJ, SPOJ, France-IOI, EliteCode ... as well as from  regional and international competitions I qualified for in person such as IOI in Iran and ACPC in Egypt.
